# Random Walk Watershed Point

This experiment is based on a question posed on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathriddles/comments/btoag5/a_random_walk_with_multiplication_finding_the/) Reddit post.

>Start with a random number between 0 and 5. Then, pick a number between 0 and that number, and multiply them together. Now, pick a number beneath that number, and multiply them together, and so on.

>The question is: what number is the watershed point in which the random numbers have an equal chance of going towards zero or infinity.

I ran a simulation and found that 2.4 is the watershed value.
